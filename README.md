# JavaScript game "Falling Fruits"

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript

## Goal og project
Creating a mini-game using the only JavaScript to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming and basic coding.

## Challenges and Approaches
First, I identified the features required for the complete game to get an overall picture, and then I started coding the simple parts in order. The function that detects collisions between the basket and fruits was the most challenging part. I solved it by creating a code that gets the X and Y coordinates, width and height of the element and detects the overlap between them.
